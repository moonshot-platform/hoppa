# Introduction 

Hoppa is a 2D Classic Platform game in arcade style developed and published by Moonshot & Ra8bits. 

# Storyline

"When a Ra8bit is denied to live the life he believes in, he has no other choice but to become an outlaw”

It is dark and cold on the moon… you could hear a pin drop, if you had one. 
There’s this box and when you get closer, squeaky noises are coming from inside. 
"Ra8bit…brap, Ra8bit! Fukkie, toot, tootfukkie! Ra8bit…many pew, poing!"

What the f….?! They’ve landed! They’re on the moon! 
The first Ra8bit ever on the moon! Do you hear thát Miss Baker!?
They totally lost control in a way that resulted in 10.000 NFT Male Ra8bits.

Now they are eager to meet some girls!
Ra8bit is on a journey to reproduce motherfuckers!
Take a carrot and head to the lobby, it starts right here!

Pick up your balls and go get the ladies in distress.
The reward is greater than the risk here!

Find the Ra8bithole, Ra8bits very own breedingroom!
